# Synology USB Storage Eject for Non-Admin Users
By default Synology allows only users with administration rights to securely eject U'SB storage devices. Users without administrator permissions dont have any Eject items. To unplug such devices without having them previously unmounted, may lead to corrupted data of corrupted file system and produces a warning on the DSM system. 
A package, which will allow gives non-admin users to securly eject external storage devices will come soon here!
